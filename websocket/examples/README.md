> Example applications written in Go with `github.com/gobwas/ws` inside.

# Applications

- [x] [Chat](https://github.com/gobwas/ws-examples/tree/master/src/chat)
- [ ] Chat CLI
- [ ] Twitter hashtag watcher

# Notes

## Commands

Currently these commands are developed:
- `bin/chat` the chat application, which is listening raw tcp socket and
  handles [jsonrpc]-like messages.
- `bin/proxy` proxy that used for two purposes. First of all, to serve static
  files for chat ui. Second and technical one is to proxy `/ws` requests to
  running chat app. This is done only for running on heroku, where only one port
  is able to be exported.

## Building

All commands can be built by `make *` or by just `make`.

The directory structure is convinient for [gb](https://getgb.io/docs/usage/)
vendoring tool. But instead of using `gb` git submodules are used to vendor
dependencies. Thus, `make vendor` will update existing submodules.

> Also, `gb` directory structure is here to signal the heroku buildpack to use
> appropriate build logic.
